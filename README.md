## Here i enclose all project i've done, most the data are publiced in Kaggle and during my master study
Contents of project:
## 1. [Kaggle EU Football SQL and python visualize](https://github.com/annguyen0302/DataScienceProject/blob/master/KaggleFootballSQL/Analysis%20and%20visualize%20SQL%20database%20by%20Python.ipynb)
For a data scientist, two must tools are Python and SQL, one used to extract the data and one used to visualize and analyze the data. SQL is a very interesting tools to analyze the data. My analyze was inspired from Dima Rudov [analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/dimarudov/data-analysis-using-sql) from Kaggle.The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) was collected from Kaggle, and it includes 25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football.

The data of this challenge was published by professor Paolo in Universita di Pavia. The data is quite simple as it include 25 variable, which are mainly financial indicator such as ROE, ROI or debt/asset rate with 1505 observation which are companies from Southern of Europe listed in the year 2015. The main goal of this project is to visualize and build machine learning model to predict the outcome result which is Default/Not.
